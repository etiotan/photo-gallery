# photo-gallery

**Synopsis**

A responsive image gallery, tested for the most popular phones on iOS & Android. Works best on Chrome.

**Challenges**

One of the biggest challenges was to make the images not squished when sizes changed. I found the design to be an issue so I got some help from my friend in graphic design.

**Solution**

At first I wanted the horizontal disabled for aesthetic purposes but I realized that would not be possible. I had to settle by enable the horizontal scroll. My graphic design friend picked apart my entire project telling me everything that was wrong with it which was key to making it look like it does now.

**Tools**

Gulp, Sass, Pug, jQuery, Javascript, & a few Javascript libraries.

**Motivation**

Will be transfered over to a friend who is a photographer!
